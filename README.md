# Design and Implementation of LQR and LQG Controllers for a two pendulum crane system
## ENPM667 - Controls for Robotic Systems

## Team Members

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main components:

### 1. System Modeling and Control
- Derivation of the crane’s equations of motion and linearization around the equilibrium point.
- Controllability analysis of the system.
- Design of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for the linearized system.
- Validation of controller performance using Lyapunov’s indirect method.

### 2. Observer Design & Output Feedback Control
- Observability analysis using different output vectors.
- Design and simulation of Luenberger observers for observable cases.
- Implementation of an LQG-based output feedback controller for reference tracking and disturbance rejection.

## Problem
The script simulates the results to solve the final project.
